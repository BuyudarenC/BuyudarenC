# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Changhao Zhao.

I am an individual who enjoys experimenting, thinking, learning, and creating.

During my undergraduate studies, I _worked as a full-stack developer_.
As a graduate student, my research focuses on the
_intersection of theory and practice in blockchain technology and consensus algorithms_.
**Looking ahead, my aspiration is to become a developer specializing in distributed database systems.**

I'm also a lover of LaTeX and Linux.
